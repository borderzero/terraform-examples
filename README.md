# Border0 Terraform Provider Examples

Welcome to the Border0 Terraform Provider examples repository. This repository contains examples of how to use the Border0 Terraform Provider to automate your Border0 infrastructure and beyond.

We have prepared a series of examples to help you get started with the Border0 Terraform Provider. Each example is a self-contained Terraform module that demonstrates how to use the Border0 Terraform Provider to automate Border0 infrastructure.
Each example includes a README file that explains the purpose of the example, the prerequisites, and how to run the example.
The subdirectories are numbered in the order you should follow to get started with the Border0 Terraform Provider, and they increase in complexity as you progress through the examples.

If you have any questions or [need help](https://docs.border0.com/docs/getting-help), please reach out to us. We are here to help you automate your Border0 infrastructure.
